# Html and css to a website.


I planned to creat a html filled website (well its a webpage but who cares?) which should be responsive and animated in a perfect style. I looked at it with the basic html and it looked good. and after all the html, I added css to the mixture and that was perfect. It worked really well and hope you all like the website.

I put all my effort and hardwork in it. I was first really sad to see that all of my css was not working out well. That made me worried and sad, but then, I got up and tried again. It worked well this time and I could finally celebrate my website's (I won't improve the web-"site" and the web-"page") creation.

I, together with my friends at the end of school improved the website. we added the button, changed the phrase under "There Is Beauty In Simplicity". I was really happy with the output of what we did and celebrated with coke and fanta.

# After The Whole Thing.


I didn't know what to do after that. I worked a bit more on the css but then i accidently broke the whole thing. My friends got real upset on me (But what could I do?) I thought of adding some js to the webpage(I got it correct there!) but my friends were fixing the webpage and had told me to not even touch the laptop!. Thus I couldn't add js that time.

Time passed and the webpage got fixed. I talked about the js to my friends and the liked the I idea. Iam still working on the js right now and I will try to get the js update soon to my webpage. The js will be added to the "Read More" button, animation and the third update which about adding more HTML to the page under the image and the other stuff. it would contain more of the text on the topic and the red more button would be leading to it. The update is the biggest one not only by the updates but it also willmark the hosting of the webpage using NameCheap.
