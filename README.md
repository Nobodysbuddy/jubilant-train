# Html and css to a website.


I planned to creat a html filled website (well its a webpage but who cares?) which should be responsive and animated in a perfect style. I looked at it with the basic html and it looked good. and after all the html, I added css to the mixture and that was perfect. It worked really well and hope you all like the website.

I put all my effort and hardwork in it. I was fist really sad to see that all of my css was not working out well. I then tried styles.js but that also didn't work. That made me worried and sad, but then, I got up and tried again with the css. It worked well and I could finally celebrate my website's (I won't improve the web-"site" and the web-"page") creation.

I got together with my friends at the end of school and we all together improved the website. we added the button, changed the phrase under "There Is Beauty In Simplicity". I was really happy with the output of what we did and celebrated with coke and fanta.
